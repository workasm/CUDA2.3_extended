How to install (for 32-bit Linux platform):

1. copy nvopencc to path/to/cuda_toolkit/open64/bin/ (* backup original nvopencc first *)

2. copy 'gfec' (gcc front-end), 'be' (compiler back-end) and 'inline' (single file inliner) to path/to/cuda_toolkit/open64/lib/ (* backup original files first *)

3. copy ext_intrinsics.h to path/to/cuda_toolkit/include/  

4. include 'ext_intrinsics.h' either directly from your code or from some library header (for instance, from 'device_functions.h')

5. add path/to/cuda_toolkit/open64/lib/ to your PATH variable (otherwise nvopencc will not find all compilation phases)
